               Scientific studies have shown over and over again that some types of background noise, like those found in an open plan office, can decrease your concentration, which makes it harder for you to process and memorize information. Interruptions by colleagues and constant noise can also cause you stress, resulting in high blood pressure and other unpleasant symptoms. As a result, people are less satisfied with their jobs and experience decreased motivation, leading to a steep decrease in creativity, collaboration, productivity, and an increase in sick leave.
